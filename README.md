# PySudoku
PySudoku is a Sudoku solver written in python. It uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle (which I will replace with a better one if the project is done.) and uses OCR to load the puzzle from an image.

~~It hosts a webpage using Flask where the user can upload a picture of their puzzle.~~ Work in progress.

*Note: I have tested this with screenshots and photos of printed puzzles. OCR may have trouble recogizing the puzzle if your image has bad lighting or if it is blurry.*

***OCR isn't working too well currently. I am working on fixing it...***
